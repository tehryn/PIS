# How to build?

If you have make and java installed, go to this build and write `make`. If you wish to build examples, write `make examples`. If you want to run an example (let's say DataTypesExample), write:

```sh
java DataTypesExample
```

## How to add targets?

If you are adding example, pretty much copy&paste DataTypesExample target, change name of the target and then add that name to `EXAMPLES` variable.

If you are adding regular target, go the datatypes way.
